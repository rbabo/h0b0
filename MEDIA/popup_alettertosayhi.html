    <p><i>a letter to say hi</i> was recorded in 2019 from April to July at Parador, a small cabin at <a

        All the songs came after going with my dearest <i><a href="https://www.thelemonlovers.com/" target="_blank">The
                Lemon Lovers</i></a> to Bucharest to be their mixing engineer (silly trusting fools*).<br>
        Those were some fun times. :) <br>
        It was recorded using a tape recorder and then sending the tracks back to Ableton.<br>
        It became a really fragile and raw album.<br>
        For a few months I started mixing it, but as usual I started finding "flaws" and transforming the songs into,
        maybe, something they were not meant to be.<br>
        At the end of the last year, I began editing some handycam footage from that time with the hope of making a
        lyric video for it.<br>
        IT WILL SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY!<BR>
        I hope. :)<br>
