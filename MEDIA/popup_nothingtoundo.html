    <p><i>nothing to undo</i> is (was?) an album I started making in 2018.<br>
        As most of the things I made it's left unfinished, although I really like some of the songs that live there.
        <br>
        Maybe there will come the time when I get back to it.<br>
        If not, maybe when I start playing live you'll get to hear more songs from it.<br>
        The title for the album came when I was recording vocals in Ableton.<br>
        But accidently recording over other vocals and trying to undo.<br>
        I ended losing the new take (and not being able to remember how it was) as well as the old one. ðŸ™ƒ<br>
        There was <i>nothing to undo</i> so might as well just move forward.</i>
